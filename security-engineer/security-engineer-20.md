A retail company is moving its e-commerce site, including its point-of-sale application, to Google Cloud. Which compliance standard must the company meet?

A. FedRAMP High

B. HIPAA

C. SOX

D. PCI DSS

## Feedback

A is not correct because FedRAMP is a U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services, hence does not fit the industry in this use case.

B is not correct because HIPAA is a federal law that established data privacy and security requirements for certain entities and individuals aimed at safeguarding individuals' health information, hence does not fit the industry in this use case.

C is not correct because SOX is relevant to accounting and financial reporting for U.S. public company. It does not address the use case.

D is correct because PCI DSS is a set of network security and business best practices guidelines adopted by the PCI Security Standards Council to establish a minimum security standard to protect customers’ payment card information. It’s relevant to the industry and workload in this use case.
