# security-engineer-01

Developers in an organization are prototyping a few applications on Google Cloud and are starting to store sensitive information on Google Cloud. The developers are using their personal/consumer Gmail accounts to set up and manage their projects within Google Cloud. A security engineer identifies this practice as a concern to the leadership team because of the lack of centralized project management and access to the data being stored in these accounts. Which solution should be used to resolve this concern?

A. Enforce the setup of Security Keys as the 2-Step Verification method for those Gmail accounts.

B. Set up Cloud Identity and require the developers to use those accounts for Google Cloud work.

C. Require the developers to log/store their Gmail passwords with the security team.

D. Enable logging on all Google Cloud projects to track all developer activities.

## Feedback

A is not correct because while it addresses some level of security concern it still doesn’t address the centralized management.

B is correct because it allows for enforcing 2SV like security features and centralized management of the identities.

C is not correct because it breaches the privacy of developers privacy and goes against the best practices.

D is not correct because it doesn’t help in restricting access or securing accounts accessing the sensitive data.
