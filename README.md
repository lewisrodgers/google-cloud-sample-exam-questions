# google-cloud-sample-exam-questions

These sample questions are sourced directly from Google Forms published by Google. The intent is to make the questions a tad easier to access and refer back to while studying for the exam.

Remember: the questions in the source material may change over time, so the questions in this repo would start to drift. So refer to both the source material and this repo while you study.
